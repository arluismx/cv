	Worked on a framework for distributed IO in a PCIe cluster in
	collaboration with Dolphin Interconnect Solutions. Gained
	experience with PCIe NTBs, high-speed interconnects, RDMA, memory
	architectures, NVM Express, GPU programming, and driver development for
	the Linux kernel.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Investigated performance issue with Intel IOMMU for PCIe
			peer-to-peer transfers for SmartIO Device Lending.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Implemented hypervisor (KVM) support using VFIO mediated device drivers
			for passing through SmartIO devices to a VM.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Contributed to the design and development of the SmartIO
			extension to the SISCI API.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Created library for developing distributed storage
			applications using SmartIO extension to SISCI.
			As proof of concept, I used this library in a CUDA program to demonstrate direct
			IO between GPUs and NVMe disks a cluster.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Developed various RDMA performance benchmarking tools.}

	metadata tags. Gained experience working with creating C++/FastCGI and
	Python/mod\_wsgi/Flask endpoints for REST services over HTTP.

	\bigskip
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Implemented a hierarchical metadata taxonomy tree that could handle creation
		and assignment of tens of thousands of metadata tags within
			milliseconds.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Created a configurable workflow utility allowing users to
			design custom pipelines for processing assets.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Made a background job scheduler with support for
			webhooks and asynchronous message-passing.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Implemented both back-end and front-end for exporting and
			managing exports to an external CMS.}\\[-.6em]
		\item{Contributed to migrating the existing code base from
		using IIS to Apache as server.}
